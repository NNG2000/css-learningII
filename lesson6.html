<h1> GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY</h1>
<P> Implement the instance method merge for the class LinkedList that has the following characteristics.
The list always starts with a dummy node, which is used as a marker for the beginning of the list. The
dummy node is never used to store data. The empty list is made up of the dummy node only;
 In the implementation for this question, the nodes in the list are doubly linked;
In this implementation, the list is circular, i.e. the reference from the last node in the list points to the
dummy node, the reference prev of the dummy node points to the last node in the list. In the empty
list, the dummy node is the first and last node of the list, its references prev and next point to the node
itself;
 The last node is easily accessible, because itâ€™s always the node preceding the dummy node, the header
of the list does not have a pointer to the tail element.
The method merge adds all the elements of the list designated by the parameter other to this list. After a call
to the method merge, the list designated by the parameter other is empty.
 This question assesses your understanding of linked structures. For this reason, you cannot use the
methods of the class LinkedList. In particular, you cannot use the methods add() or remove().
 The method never throws an exception.</P>
